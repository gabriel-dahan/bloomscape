# BloomScape (source-code)

**BloomScape** is a relaxing and strategic online game based on a simulation of a market economy composed of flowers only.
Manage your garden, cultivate rare species, and trade your harvests in a dynamic market within a closed economy.

## Key Features

- **Garden Management:** Plant, water, and grow your flowers in real-time. Careful, without care, they wither!
- **Rarity System:** Discover species of varying rarity, from common to legendary flowers.
- **Player-vs-Player Market:** Sell your finest harvests for **Sap** (virtual currency) or buy missing flowers for your collection: beware, species prices can fluctuate.
- **Progression:** Level up to unlock new seeds and expand your land.
- **Floradex:** Complete your botanical collection album.
